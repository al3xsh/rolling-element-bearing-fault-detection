# Rolling Element Bearing Fault Detection Using Deep Learning

This is the repository to go with the paper "A novel deep learning model for the detection and identification of rolling element bearing faults". It will contain code to run all the experiments from the paper and generate the result plots.

(currently this repository is a stub - waiting for the paper to be accepted)
